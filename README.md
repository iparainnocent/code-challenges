# Wk1 Code Challenge - Toy problem
## Prerequisites: 

1. Create a repository on your GitHub account. 

_NB: One folder, with 3-4 files for each solution. Please note that a single file should only hold one solution._

2. Use JavaScript to wire down the solution.

3. Push the solution to the above repository once done.

4. Submit the repository link for grading.

5. Ensure your repository has a well written README.

NOTE: You are required to complete ALL the challenges.

There are three quizes in the code challenge where each one is required to manupilate and handle it using javascript

## System Requirements

- Abrowser capable of running javascript (chrome)
- Operatingv System(Linux)
- A text editor capable of running javascript (Visual Studio Code)
- RAM - 4GB

## Installation
To use this repo, follow these steps:

- Create a respiratory in your github account to link with your work code in visual studio code.
 - Open your terminal in Visual Studio Code
- As you continue coding run the codes in your terminal using node.js


# Student Grade Calculator

This is a simple JavaScript function that prompts the user to input student marks and returns the corresponding grade.

#### Usage

To use the function, simply call the `getStudentGrade()` function in your JavaScript code. The function will prompt the user to enter the student's marks, and then return the corresponding grade based on the following order:

- A: Marks greater than 79
- B: Marks between 60 and 79 (inclusive)
- C: Marks between 49 and 59 (inclusive)
- D: Marks between 40 and 49 (inclusive)
- E: Marks less than 40

Here's an example of how to use the function:

const grade = getStudentGrade();
console.log(`The student's grade is: ${grade}`);

file name "student grade.js"

## Speed Detector
 
This is a JavaScript program that calculates the demerit points for a given car speed. If the speed is less than 70 km/h, the program will print "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/h above the speed limit (70 km/h), the program will give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points. If the driver gets more than 12 demerit points, the program will print "License suspended".

#### Usage

To use the program, simply call the `speedOfTheCar()` function and pass the car speed as an argument. The function will return a string with the result.

Here's an example:

const carSpeed = 80;
const result = demeritPoints(carSpeed);

file name"speed detector.js"

# Net salary calculator

here, we are to write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual's Net Salary by getting the inputs of the basic salary and benefits. A link is provided to get the grosssalaries and the deductions.

#### Usage

To use the program, simply call the `individualsNetSalary()` function and pass the Basic Salary and Benefits as arguments. The function will return an object containing the calculated values.

Here's an example:
const individualsNetSalary = grossSalary - payee - nhifDeduction - nssfDeduction;

The file name is "net.js"
